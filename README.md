Eluvio Coding Challenge - Option 1 - Data Science/ML

<br/>

My name is Zafir Momin and I am a first year graduate student at NYU's Center for Data Science. This is my submission for the Eluvio Coding Challenge.
<br/>

Thank you for considering me for this internship! I actually had fun working on this challenge and I discovered insights that I thought were quite cool. I learned new things and I gained experience working on my submission. Once again, thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon.
